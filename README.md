# Add disctintive class name to current navigation route


Everything started trying to solve this problem on my own project:

- [Active link class using wire:navigate in persist mode](https://github.com/livewire/livewire/discussions/6043).

Then I shared my solution and prepared a video:

- [Livewire - How to add a distinctive class name to current route on navigation links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqg0h4E3u_c&ab_channel=OscarAlderete).

And finally someone asked for a repo with the code so, there's the reason for this one. I hope you can find it useful and I'll be pleased if you star this project, thanks!
